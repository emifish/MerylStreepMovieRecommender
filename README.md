Meryl Streep Movie Recommender was created as a follow up to a friendly New Years resolution/goal to watch more Meryl Streep movies.
This project explores Machine Learning Clustering to create a recommendation engine for folks interested in watching a Meryl movie.
I used Streamlit Community Cloud for the UI layer.
